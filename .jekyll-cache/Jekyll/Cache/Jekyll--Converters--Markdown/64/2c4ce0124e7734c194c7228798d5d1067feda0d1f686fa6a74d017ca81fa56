I"ò<p><strong>For the crust</strong>: Combine the flour, cornmeal, salt, sugar, and yeast in a bowl. Give those ingredients a quick toss with a large wooden spoon. Add the warm water and 1/4 cup of melted butter. Make sure neither is too hot (around <strong>90 degrees F</strong>). On low speed, beat (or stir) the dough ingredients until everything begins to be moistened. remove from the bowl and knead by hand, beat the dough until it is soft and supple and gently pulls away from the sides of the bowl and falls off of the dough hook- about 4-5 minutes. If the dough is too hard (it will be textured from the cornmeal), but if it feels too tough, beat in 1 teaspoon of warm water. Alternatively, if it feels too soft, beat in 1 Tablespoon of flour.</p>
