    - Put in everything except 1 sage leaf (save if for garnish).
    - Shake (depends on the ice, but 20 seconds should do it) and strain. Serve it up, which means no ice.
    - To use the fresh sage leaf for garnish, first "spank" it (put it on one open palm and slap it with the other hand a few times) to release essential oils. Place it on top of the drink.
