      **For the crust**: Combine the flour, cornmeal, salt, sugar, and yeast in a bowl. Give those ingredients a quick toss with a large wooden spoon. Add the warm water and 1/4 cup of melted butter. Make sure neither is too hot (ideally **90 degrees F**). On low speed, beat (or stir) the dough ingredients until everything begins to be moistened. remove from the bowl and knead by hand, beat the dough until it is soft- about 4-5 minutes. If the dough is too hard, beat in 1 teaspoon of warm water. Alternatively, if it feels too soft, beat in 1 Tablespoon of flour.

      Form dough into a ball. Coat the dough with olive oil (i.e. cover bowl with grease and roll the dough around in it). Cover dough with aluminum foil. Preheat oven to 250F. Once there, turn off oven and place bowl inside. Allow yeast to rise for 1-2 hours or when it doubles in size.

      Once ready, lightly flour a large work surface. Remove dought from foil, and gently punch down the dough to remove air bubles and roll the dough in a large rectangle. Spread rest of butter on top of the dough. Roll it up lengthwise and then into a ball, coat with oil again. Cover with aluminum foil and place in fridge. Allow yeast to rise for 1 hour or until you make the sauce.
